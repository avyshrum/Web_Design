<h2>The Past Decade of VR</h2>
<p>
<hr>
In 2012 Palmer Luckey launched a Kickstarter for the Oculus Rift which raised $2.4 million. This Kickstarter, and the resulting development of the Oculus Rift, led to greater interest in virtual reality. The popularity of the Oculus company increased and in 2014 Facebook bought the Oculus VR company for $2 billion. In 2016 HTC released its HTC VIVE SteamVR headset. This was the first commercial release of a headset with sensor-based tracking. Being able to move freely is an important factor in feeling immersed in virtual reality but being able to move about easily outside of virtual reality is also important to others. In 2019, the Oculus Quest was released as the first standalone headset, which meant being connected to a PC was no longer needed and people could now move even more freely when using a headset. In 2020 The Oculus Quest 2 was unveiled, and since then it has become the best-selling headset. Its affordability and technology, like being able to use it tethered to a computer or standalone, have made it a go-to choice for millions. 
<hr>
Currently, a base model 128GB Quest 2 costs $299, this is a much more appealing price than headsets that cost over $1,000. However, there are headsets like the Valve Index for people who are greatly interested in virtual reality and are willing to pay the price for a more high-tech headset. According to the article “<a href="https://www.livescience.com/valve-index-review" target="_blank">Valve Index review: The pinnacle of VR technology</a>”, “Thanks to its advanced screen technology, finger-tracking controllers, and accurate motion tracking stations, the Valve Index is the most comprehensive VR package you can currently have in your home.”. The most important feature of this headset is being able to move about a room while your body’s movements are tracked and displayed in virtual reality, this feature grants a whole new level of immersion.
