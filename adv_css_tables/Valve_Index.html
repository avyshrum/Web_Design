<h2>The Valve Index</h2>
<p>
    <hr>
The Valve Index is a PC only headset, which means it has to be tethered to a PC in order to be used. However, this headset makes up for that with better quality. This headset has better sound, a wider field of view, and game graphics are much better than what you see using Quest 2 standalone. This headset is also made to be used with SteamVR senors, these allow for tracking in VR. Generally better graphics and the potential for tracking make this a great heasdset. It does come at a steep price, $1,000.
