<h2>The Meta Quest 2</h2>
<p>
<hr>
The Meta Quest 2 is both a PC and standalone headset, which means it can be used with a PC or it can be used by itself. This headset is a good because you have the option to use it wherever you have space, no pc required. While many of it’s standalone games have lower graphical quality compared to PC VR games, the experience of using the headset without a cord in the way is great. If you do have a VR capable PC then that opens up your options even further, all you need is a link cable to hook up to your PC! It’s price is on the more affordable side compared to most headsets, it’s $300 for the 128 GB Quest.
