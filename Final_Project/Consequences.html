<h2>Consequences</h2>

In the article “Garbage Patches,” last updated Sep 21 2023, on marinedebris.noaa.gov, a part of the United States Department of Commerce, where one of their tasks is climate monitoring, “Generally speaking, we know that humans may be exposed to microplastics from a number of sources…” “Plastic microfibers can also be transported in the air and found in household dust (e.g., from furniture, carpet, clothing etc.), so exposure from seafood and other ocean sources may be small in comparison. The research community is actively exploring this issue.” Besides microplastics possibly being in seafood there are other issues “…the amount of debris may continue to grow as more and more debris enters our ocean each year. This growth will likely worsen current impacts on the environment, navigation, vessel safety, and the economy.” There are quite a few negative consequences caused by ocean pollution.
