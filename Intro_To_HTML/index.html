    <h1>The Legend of Zelda Manga</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Did you know that The Legend of Zelda video game series also has manga to read? Since 1989 there has been manga to read for this series! A lot of them are retellings of the video games' stories. I haven't played any of the games myself so I find the manga to be a great way to learn about The Legend of Zelda! So, if you don't have the time, or would just rather not play the games, try reading the manga that's available! Here, I'll talk about what I have read myself, there is more to read than what I mention here! For a full list of manga visit the <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Manga" target="_blank">Zelda Wiki</a>.</p>

    <h2>The Legendary Edition Manga</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Legendary Edition manga is a great set to have! It contains five books but some of the books contain more than one story. So theres a variety to read! The art and story of these books was created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/akira_himekawa/" target="_blank">Akira Himekawa</a>, which is a pen name for A. Honda and S. Nagano. My favorite was the Four Swords manga! I really enjoyed that one, it was hilarious!</p>
    <h3>List of Legendary Edition titles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ocarina of Time</li>
            <li>Oracle of Seasons/Oracle of Ages</li>
            <li>The Minish Cap/Phantom Hourglass</li>
            <li>Majora's Mask/A Link to the Past</li>
            <li>Four Swords</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Twilight Princess Manga</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Twilight Princess manga, also by Akira Himekawa, started in 2016 and finished in 2022. This series spans 11 volumes and is full of beautiful art. It's a fantastic series which follows a lot of The Twilight Princess game's events while also adding brand new parts to the story! For example, it gives Link a backstory that wasn't in the video game.</p>
